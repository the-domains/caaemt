The mission of the California Association of Emergency
Medical Technicians is to serve the prehospital EMS care providers of
California by presenting networking opportunities, offer continuing education,
work with CAAEMT partners to give discounts on services and products, and
represent its membership during discussions that will readily affect their
practice and protocols.
